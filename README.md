# Accident Prevention System for Blind Turns

## Abstract
> With an improvement in technology and miniaturisation of sensors, there have been attempts to utilize the new technology in various areas to improve the quality of human life. Today, road traffic injuries are one of the leading causes of death, disabilities and hospitalization in the country. There are many dangerous roads in the world like mountain roads, narrow curve roads, T roads. The problem in these curve roads is drivers canâ€™t able to see the vehicle or obstacles coming from other end of the curve. The solution for this problem is alerting the driver about the obstacle or vehicle. Usually horn is used for this purpose but it is not a valid. To avoid these problems in curve roads or T roads we are keeping the ultrasonic sensor in both side of the road before the curve and keeping a LED light after the curve ,so that vehicle comes from one side of curve a senses and LED light glow at opposite side.  By viewing the LED light on /off criteria the motive force can become alert and may hamper the speed of vehicle.

## Project Outline
> In this project, I have proposed a system based on integration of various modules such as, ultrasonic distance sensor HC SR04 , Arduino UNO , LED , etc., to avoid collision of vehicles due to  blind curve. The purpose of the system is to indicate by turning LED on in blind curves when vehicles approach each other and alert the driver. A sensor set is included in this system.

## Components used in this project

1. Arduino Uno
2. Ultrasonic Snesor
3. LED 5mm
4. Resistor (1K Ohm)
5. Bread Boards
6. Jumper Wires

## Conclusion
> The purpose of this paper is to decrease the amount of accidents on curve roads which was done by alerting the driver by means of LED light by glowing when vehicle came from the opposite side of the curve. Everything was detected by the assistance of ultrasonic sensor which was interfaced with the arduino.
