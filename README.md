# Accident Prevention System for Blind Turns

## Abstract

> With an improvement in technology and the miniaturisation of sensors, there have been attempts to utilise the new technology in various areas to improve the quality of human life. Today, road traffic injuries are one of the leading causes of death, disability, and hospitalisation in the country. There are many dangerous roads in the world, like mountain roads, narrow-curve roads, and T-roads. The problem with these curve roads is that drivers canâ€™t see the vehicle or obstacles coming from the other end of the curve. The solution to this problem is to alert the driver about the obstacle or vehicle. Usually, horn is used for this purpose, but it is not valid. To avoid these issues on curve roads or T-roads, we keep the ultrasonic sensor on both sides of the road before the curve and a LED light after the curve, so that when the vehicle comes from one side of the curve, the LED light glows on the opposite side. By viewing the LED light on/off criteria, the motive force can become alert and may hamper the speed of the vehicle.

## Project Outline

> In this project, I proposed a system based on the integration of various modules, such as an ultrasonic distance sensor HC SR04, an Arduino UNO, LEDs, and so on, to avoid vehicle collisions caused by blind curves. The purpose of the system is to indicate by turning the LED on in blind curves when vehicles approach each other and alert the driver. A sensor set is included in this system.

## Components used in this project

1. Arduino Uno
2. Ultrasonic Snesor
3. LED 5mm
4. Resistor (1K Ohm)
5. Bread Boards
6. Jumper Wires

## Conclusion
> The purpose of this paper is to decrease the number of accidents on curve roads, which was done by alerting the driver by means of LED lights by glowing when a vehicle comes from the opposite side of the curve. Everything was detected by the assistance of an ultrasonic sensor, which was interfaced with the Arduino.
